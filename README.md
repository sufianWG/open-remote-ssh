### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Configure SSH Host (Optional)
Create or edit `~/.ssh/config`:

```ssh
Host my-remote-server
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User myusername
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### 2. Connect to Remote Host
- **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`
- **Type**: "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..."
- **Select**: Choose your configured host or "Manual Connection"

#### 3. Authentication
- For password auth: Enter password when prompted
- For key-based auth: Ensure your SSH key has proper permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

#### 4. Remote Workspace
Once connected, you can:
- Browse remote files in the Explorer
- Edit files with full IntelliSense support
- Open integrated terminals (automatically on remote)
- Debug applications running on remote
- Install extensions on remote host

### Available Commands

- `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...` - Connect to a remote SSH host
- `Remote-SSH: Disconnect from Host` - Disconnect current session
- `Remote-SSH: Open Terminal` - Open terminal on remote host
- `Remote-SSH: Settings` - Open extension settings
- `Remote-SSH: Show Log` - View connection logs

### Remote Explorer

The extension adds a "Remote Explorer" view to the Activity Bar:
1. Click the Remote Explorer icon
2. View all configured SSH hosts
3. Click on a host to connect
4. Right-click for more options

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Access settings through your editor's settings or `settings.json`:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `remote-ssh.configFile` | string | `~/.ssh/config` | Path to SSH configuration file |
| `remote-ssh.showLoginTerminal` | boolean | `false` | Show terminal during connection process |
| `remote-ssh.defaultExtensions` | array | `[]` | Extensions to install on remote by default |
| `remote-ssh.connectTimeout` | number | `15000` | Connection timeout in milliseconds |

### Example Configuration

```json
{
    "remote-ssh.configFile": "~/.ssh/config",
    "remote-ssh.showLoginTerminal": true,
    "remote-ssh.defaultExtensions": [
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
        "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    ],
    "remote-ssh.connectTimeout": 30000
}
```

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Development on Deployment OS**: Work directly on the same OS as production
- **Resource-Intensive Tasks**: Use powerful remote servers for heavy computation
- **Consistent Environment**: Share development environments across team
- **IoT Development**: Develop directly on Raspberry Pi or other devices
- **Cloud Development**: Connect to cloud VMs without local setup
- **Multi-Machine Workflow**: Access different environments from one editor

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Verify SSH Access**: Test connection via terminal first
   ```bash
   ssh user@hostname
   ```

2. **Check SSH Config**: Ensure config file syntax is correct

3. **Firewall/Network**: Verify port 22 (or custom port) is accessible

4. **Authentication**: Ensure correct credentials or key permissions
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

### Performance Tips

- Use connection multiplexing in SSH config
- Keep stable network connection
- Consider using tmux/screen for persistent sessions
- Install only necessary extensions on remote

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Extension not appearing in PearAI/other editors
- **Solution**: Ensure your editor supports VS Code extensions
- Check compatibility with your editor version

**Issue**: "Host key verification failed"
- **Solution**: Add host to known_hosts:
  ```bash
  ssh-keyscan -H hostname >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  ```

**Issue**: Connection timeout
- **Solution**: Increase timeout in settings or check network connectivity
